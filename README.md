# XAI_Feature-Importance

Network Traffic CLassifcation using Machine learning

## Summary:
- Traditional methods of network classification, such as port scanning and packet inspection, are becoming inefficient due to the rapid evolution of darknet technology.
Recent developments in deep learning have shown promise in tackling these issues by picking up complicated patterns and adapting to shifting network environments.
- However, the accuracy of classification can be impacted by the selection of relevant features, and computationally expensive models can be produced by using all features.
- This research suggests using XAI approaches to find the most pertinent characteristics and provide insights into the classification process to enhance the efficacy of deep learning models.
- The usefulness of this approach is demonstrated by experimental findings on a Convolutional Neural Network and Long-Short Term Memory deep learning models trained on the CIC-Darknet 2020 dataset.
- LIME and SHAP are used to acquire model explanations and determine feature importance, and the results obtained through these methods are validated.

## LIME:
LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) is an XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence) technique that aims to provide insights into how a machine learning model arrived at a particular prediction. It is a model-agnostic method that can be used with any black-box model, including deep neural networks, decision trees, or support vector machines.

The main idea behind LIME is to locally approximate the complex model with an interpretable one, and use this approximation to explain individual predictions. LIME generates local explanations by perturbing a few features around the instance being explained, and observing the impact on the model's output. These perturbations are done using a sampling method that ensures the generated explanation is faithful to the original data distribution.

LIME provides a simple and intuitive way to understand the behavior of machine learning models and identify any biases or flaws in the model. It allows humans to verify if the model is performing as intended, and if not, what changes need to be made to improve the model's performance.

In the context of question-answering systems, LIME can help explain how the model arrived at its answer for a given question and context. This can be particularly useful in identifying cases where the model may

## SHAP:
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is another XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence) technique that aims to provide insights into how a machine learning model arrived at a particular prediction. It is based on the Shapley value from cooperative game theory, which assigns a value to each feature by measuring its contribution to the model's prediction.

The main idea behind SHAP is to compute the contribution of each feature to the model's output by evaluating the model's output for all possible combinations of features. This is computationally expensive, so SHAP uses a sampling method to approximate the Shapley values. The resulting values can be used to explain individual predictions, compare the importance of different features, and even detect interactions between features.

SHAP provides a flexible and model-agnostic way to understand the behavior of machine learning models and identify any biases or flaws in the model. It allows humans to verify if the model is performing as intended, and if not, what changes need to be made to improve the model's performance.
